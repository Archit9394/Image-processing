# Image-processing

6 Matlab files are attached.

1) DIP_project_2_hough_gray.m	- 	This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using hough transform for gray images	
2) DIP_project_2_hough_set1.m 	- This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using hough transform for set 1 images.
3) DIP_project_2_hough_set1.m	- 	This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using hough transform for set 2 images.
4) DIP_project_part2_hough_color.m -	This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using hough transform for color images.
5) DIP_project_part2_method_2.m - 	  This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using cross-correlation for all images.
6) DIP_project_part2_blob_detection.m-	This file contains matlab script to find centers and diameter using blob detection for all images.

If you have to execute the code for a particular image, just remove the '%' sign of that particular image and run it.
you will need to give the directory address at the begining of the script. I hope it won't be difficult to run it.

THANK YOU
