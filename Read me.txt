6 Matlab files are attached.

1) Coin_detection_HoughTransform_gray_images.m	- This contains codes to find centers and diameter using hough transform for gray images	
2) Coin_detection_Hough_set1.m 	- This contains codes to find centers and diameter using hough transform for set 1 images.
3) Coin_detection__Hough_set2.m	- This contains codes to find centers and diameter using hough transform for set 2 images.
4) Coin_detection__Hough_Color_images.m - This contains codes to find centers and diameter using hough transform for color images.
5) Coin_detection_cross_correlation.m - This contains codes to find centers and diameter using cross-correlation for all images.
6) Coin_detection_blob_detection.m- This contains codes to find centers and diameter using blob detection for all images.

If you have to execute the code for a particular image, just remove the '%' sign of that particular image and run it.
you will need to give the directory address at the begining of the script. I hope it won't be difficult to run it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THANK YOU~~~~~~~~~~~~
